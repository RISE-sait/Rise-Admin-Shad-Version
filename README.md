## Development Guidelines

### Branching & PR Workflow

We follow a structured Git flow:

- Always branch off `main`.
- Branch naming convention:
  - `feature/short-description`
  - `bugfix/short-description`
  - `hotfix/short-description`

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-user-management`
- `bugfix/fix-login-redirect`

#### Opening a Pull Request (PR)

1. Push your feature branch.
2. Open a PR targeting the `main` branch.
3. Fill out the PR template (auto-filled when opening a PR).
4. Assign a reviewer.
5. Address feedback and merge upon approval.

âœ… Keep PRs small and focused (<300 lines ideally).  
âœ… Always test locally before opening a PR.
